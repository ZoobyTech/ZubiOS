THIS ISN'T BUILT YET!
...

This is a proprietary program.
You cannot build this!
Please replace this STUB with the proprietary code, zstdlib.so (or libZooby if GNU)!
You can try making an Open-Source replacement, but that would personally offend me. Thanks!
And please don't do that, that'd hurt my pride.
