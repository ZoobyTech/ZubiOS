INIT File!

This is super basic right now... Sorry!

All it does is load the linker & loads the Standard Library & then calls ZSH...
If you exit ZSH, your entire kernel panics...
AGain!
Sorry!!

Feel free to make a custom init script, you can even use "zsh" as the init if you want but that'd be pretty weird.

What it does:

Calls ld.so once (to make sure it's daemon is running... yes, the bloody daemon is a runtime service... I don't know how GNU does what it does, so I improvised! Good thing is, all virtual memory is actually in its own memory space, so you can look at it to see how much memory shared libraries are using.)
Calls /Bin/ZSH, falls back to...
Kernel panic!
Booyah!!

I'll make a recovery mode later, sorry I'm just slow.

FYI, /Bin/ZSH Doesn't even work yet on this Distro so...
You can't even use it!

Don't use this distro yet :heart:
Unless you'd like to contribute.
I am open to making the init Open Source if someone manages to make one better than my proprietary one.
Of which, if they push it, I'll reluctantly accept it since I suppose...
An INIT should be open source, for security & user freedom.
